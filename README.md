Hi! 👋🏻 my name is Ruchir. I'm a web developer and designer and I like my privacy. I've created this website to use my files as global so I can access them whenever I can. Once I came across an issue when I had to use a specific file format for testing and demonstration purposes for a big project. and I found no sample file to use, that's why I created this site.
